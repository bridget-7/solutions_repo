Introduction ### Purpose of the Study In this report we will be studying the motion of a projectile. The goal of this study is to develop a clear mathematical model that describes how different factors, like the angle of launch and initial velocity, affect the range and trajectory of the projectile. ## 2. Theoretical Foundation ### 2.1 Governing Equations of Motion There are basic equations that govern the motion of a projectile. These equations describe the horizontal and vertical displacements over time, considering an initial velocity and launch angle. # Derivation of Governing Equations of Motion ## 1. Horizontal Motion In projectile motion, the horizontal velocity remains constant (neglecting air resistance). The horizontal displacement is given by: \\[ x= v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t \\] where: - \\(v_0\\) is the initial velocity, -$\\thetas is the launch angle, - \\(t\\) is time.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#projectile-motion-simulation","text":"","title":"Projectile Motion Simulation"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#1-introduction","text":"### Purpose of the Study In this report we will be studying the motion of a projectile.
