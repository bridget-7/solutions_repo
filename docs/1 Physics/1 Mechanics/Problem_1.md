## 1. Introduction


 ### Purpose of the Study

 In this report we will be studying the motion of a projectile. The goal of this study is to develop a clear mathematical model that describes how different factors, like the angle of launch and initial velocity, affect the range and trajectory of the projectile.



 ## 2. Theoretical Foundation


 ### 2.1 Governing Equations of Motion


 There are basic equations that govern the motion of a projectile. These equations describe the horizontal and vertical displacements over time, considering an initial velocity and launch angle.



 # Derivation of Governing Equations of Motion



 ## 1. Horizontal Motion

In projectile motion, the horizontal velocity remains constant (neglecting air resistance). The horizontal displacement is given by:

$$
 x= v_0 \cos(\theta) t
 $$


 where:

 -$v_0$ is the initial velocity,

 -$\thetas is the launch angle,

 -$t$ is time.
